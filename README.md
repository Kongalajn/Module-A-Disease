For working on your own I suggest Spyder and Anaconda for downloads. Both should be available from Anaconda site.

All work should be done from the branch called "testversion", and then commited to the master once additions to the code have proven to work. Don't add code directly to the "Master" branch and break anything! This means we have 2 active saved files, and we save our work by Committing.

This readme should contain all the stuff we need to know, and updated as we go along.

For example:

TO DO
Set up github repository – Alex CHECK
Add and teach Silo how to use Github
Read notes from lecture – both
Learn basic python – Silo
Find travel data
Choose cities – 6 large cities around Skåne CHECK
Zoho document for updating, add to do list to document - this is the Github readme CHECK

Cities
Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Copenhagen, Aarhus, Hamburg

MEASLES

Factors: Recovery, infection rate, interaction, prevention, Q: Is person dead or immune after infection?

GRAPH
